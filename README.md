# Software Systems final project
## Group 38: Kyle Riley, Federico Ortiz, Clare Harshey

This project simulates a marketplace system consisting of five classes: Item, Buyer, Seller, Order and Marketplace. The marketplace itself handles the user interface, account creation and login, uploading inventory, search functions, reading/writing from iles, etc. The data necessary for these methods are stored in ArrayList as attributes: lists of items, orders, sellers, buyers, and categories. Marketplace therefore aggregates all the other classes. Data will be written to text files for state persistence at the end of each session, and read in at the beginning of the next session.
