To run the program, compile and run the Marketplace class’s main method. Alternatively, you can create a new instance of the marketplace class, and call the run() method. Ex:

	new Marketplace.run();

The program requires the following six text files to run:

	buyers
	sellers
	admin
	orders
	items
	categories

These text files, which contain data from past runs of the Marketplace, are located in a folder called “data”. This folder must be placed adjacent to the folder containing the source code. For example, if the source code is located in a folder called “src” with the path “c:\project\src\”, then the path of the data folder should be “c:\project\data\”. 

Templates for these program files are located in an adjacent folder "templates"; javadoc documentation is located in "javadoc"; and "documentation" contains our project report, UML diagram, and program screenshots. 

To login as the administrator, go to the login menu, and type “admin” (without the quotes) for the e-mail address. Then type admin again for the password.

To login as a buyer or seller, you can do one of two things: 1. create either a buyer or seller account, which will then automatically log you in. 2. Use one of the already created login credentials located in the buyers.txt or sellers.txt.

For your convenience, here is one of the buyer credentials:

	Email:		SHenderson@iub.edu
	Password:	catz

And here is one of the seller credentials:

	Email:		bob@bobsBookstore.net
	Password:	Asparagus333
